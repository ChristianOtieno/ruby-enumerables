## Work Done

- [x] Create #my_each, a method that is identical to #each but (obviously) does not use #each.
- [x] Create #my_each_with_index in the same way.
- [x] Create #my_select in the same way, though you may use #my_each in your definition (but not #each).
- [x] Create #my_all?
- [x] Create #my_any?
- [x] Create #my_none?
- [x] Create #my_count
- [x] Create #my_map
- [x] Create #my_inject
- [x] Test #my_inject in the #multiply_els method.
- [x] Modify #my_map method to take a proc instead.
- [x] Modify #my_map method to take either a proc or a block.
